# Reactjs-ExpenseTrackerApp
The ExpenseTrackerApp is a React.js web application that showcases my skills in building efficient and practical expense tracking tools..The ExpenseTrackerApp employs React's useState hook to manage the application's state efficiently.The app demonstrates my understanding of React component communication by passing props from child components to the parent component. This allows for seamless data exchange and updating of the application's state.
